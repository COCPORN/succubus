The repository will go public once it reaches a 0.2-release.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThese are the current and planned features of Succubus:\r\n\r\n- Event publishing and consumption\r\n- Synchronous calls with request/response\r\n- Orchestration of synchronous messages\r\n- Timeouts of synchronous messages\r\n- Planned for 0.3:\r\n\t- Deferred messaging\r\n\t- Addressable commands\r\n\t- Work-item fan out\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n----\r\n\r\nSuccubus is implemented just for fun, don't expect to see any best-in-class implementations or super stable code, at least not at this point. It is intended to have few dependencies, be quick to develop with and accommodate some \"special\" use cases. Most of the things implemented by Succubus are fairly simple to implement directly on ZeroMQ, but the idea is to take some of the hassle out of it when working with C#.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nGet lastest version of Succubus from GitHub or NuGet (will be up soon).\r\n\r\nInstantiation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nTo instantiate a handle to the bus, create an instance of `Succubus.Core.Bus`:\r\n```C#\r\nIBus bus = new Succubus.Core.Bus();\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach handle will have a separate channel to the message host. Each handle will also have separate event handlers, and synchronous message responses need to be handled on the same bus as the request.\r\n\r\nSingleton instantiation\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nSuccubus allows you to get a singleton instance in addition to newing up objects. Note that the singleton object will always (obviously) point to the same instance, while all newed objects will be different. These can co-exist and will use separate message channels:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nBus.Instance.Initialize(config => {\r\n    config.StartMessageHost =  true;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitialization\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nBefore using the bus, it needs to be initialized:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nBus.Instance.Initialize();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Initialize`-call to the bus alternatively returns a configuration handle.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.Initialize(succubus =>\r\n{\r\n    succubus.StartMessageHost = true;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the parameterless Initialize call, the bus will be initialized with default values.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThere are a number of methods that allow you to configure your bus instance before using it. These calls can be found in the `IBusConfigurator`-interface, but will be documented in detail in the future.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n        #region Communication        \r\n        string PublishAddress { get; set; }\r\n        string SubscribeAddress { get; set; }\r\n        #endregion\r\n\r\n        #region Hosting\r\n        string MessageHostPublishAddress { get; set; }\r\n        string MessageHostSubscribeAddress { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        bool StartMessageHost { get; set; }\r\n        #endregion\r\n\r\n        #region Filtering\r\n        string Network { get; set;  }        \r\n        #endregion\r\n\r\n        #region Configuration sources\r\n        void GetFromConfigurationFile();\r\n        #endregion\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost of these should be self explanatory. Network is currently not implemented.\r\n\r\nEvents\r\n------\r\n\r\nSuccubus supports publishing and consuming events. Events are agnostic to where they are posted from and who consumes them. A single event can have multiple consumers.\r\n\r\n### Publishing events\r\n\r\nPublish events by calling the `Publish`-method:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.Publish(new BasicEvent { Message = \"Hi, there! \"});\r\n```\r\n\r\n`BasicEvent` is a user defined POCO-class:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class BasicEvent\r\n{\r\n    public string Message { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Consuming events\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in handling an event, use the `On`-method:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.On<BasicEvent>(e => {\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Got event: {0}\", e.Message)\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSynchronous processing\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nSuccubus supports two types of synchronous calling; static and transient routes. A transient route is setup as the call is made, and is removed after a call has been processed, while a static route is permanent in the bus.\r\n\r\nWhen using synchronous processing, the _client_ side of the interaction needs to use a variation of the `Call`-method and the _server_ side then replies using the `ReplyTo`-method.\r\n\r\n### Replying to messages\r\n\r\nWhen a message is presented from the bus after being sent with the `Call`-method, it can be handled with the `ReplyTo`-method:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.ReplyTo<BasicRequest, BasicResponse>(request => {\r\n\treturn new BasicResponse { Message = request.Message + \" echoed from server\" };\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `BasicRequest` and `BasicResponse` are user defined POCO-classes; Succubus will handle any routing information behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n### Transient routes\r\n\r\nTransient routes are simple request/response-pairs.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.Call<Request, Response>(new Request { Message = \"Hi from client\"},\r\n\tresponse => {\r\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Got response from server: {0}\", response.Message);\r\n\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\nA transient call with request/response-parameters will register a route and wrap the request/response objects in a `SynchronousMessageFrame` which decorates the messages with `CorrelationId`s. If multiple responses are made to the same synchronous call, only the first will be handled in the defined response handler, while the other messages will be raised as events.\r\n\r\n### Static routes\r\n\r\nStatic routes allow for reuse of handler structures and more advanced orchestration.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.OnReply<BasicRequest, BasicResponse>((request, response) => \r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"OnReply<TReq, TRes>: Got a response handled on static handler: {0} => {1}\", \r\n    request.Message, \r\n    response.Message));\r\nbus.Call<BasicRequest>(new BasicRequest { Message = \"Hello from client\"} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuccubus will store the request until the response arrives, so both can be handled in the same context.\r\n\r\n### Response filtering\r\n\r\nYou can setup response filtering through inheritance. Example:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class BaseResponse \r\n{\r\n    public string Message { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class SuccessResponse \r\n{\r\n    public SuccessResponse() \r\n    {\r\n        Message = \"All went well\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class FailureResponse \r\n{\r\n    public FailureResponse() \r\n    {\r\n        Message = \"What a catastrophic failure.\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Request \r\n{\r\n    public string Message { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these classes we can setup the handling of the static routes.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.ReplyTo<Request,BaseResponse>((req) =>\r\n{\r\n    if (failure)\r\n    {\r\n        return new FailureResponse();\r\n    }\r\n    else \r\n    {\r\n        return new SuccessResponse();\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, on the client side, we can handle both responses separately:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.OnReply<Request, FailureResponse>((req, res) =>\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Shoot, something went wrong processing the request: {0}\", res.Message);\r\n});\r\n\r\nbus.OnReply<Request, SuccessResponse>((req, res) =>\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Everything processed without a hitch: {0}\", res.Message);\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to do:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.OnReply<Request, BaseResponse>((req, res) =>\r\n{\r\n    if (res is FailureResponse) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    } else if (res is SuccessResponse) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means you can route incoming responses based on interface-definitions and abstract classes, in addition to obviously concrete classes.\r\n\r\n### Timeouts\r\n\r\nSynchronized processing supports timeout handlers on a per-`Call` basis. Example:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.Call(new BasicRequest { Message = \"Hello! \"}, (req) => {\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"BasicRequest timed out for: {0}\", req.Message)\r\n}, 2500); // Timeout in milliseconds\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf no parameters are provided, the call will time out silently after \r\none minute. To make a response handler never time out, manually provide\r\nthe value of 0.\r\n\r\n### Orchestration\r\n\r\nSynchronous processing in Succubus opens up for complex orchestration of up to 7 responses. Example:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.OnReply<UpdateRequest, \r\n            ImageProcessed, \r\n            FriendNotified>((ur, ip, fn) =>\r\n{\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"New profile image has been processed with response: {0}\", ip.Status);\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Friends have been notified with response: {0}\", fn.Status);\r\n});\r\n\t\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Deferrence (0.3)\r\n\r\nSuccubus supports deferring message handling. This is convenient when you are doing synchronous processing, but the response set needs to be handled in another context than where the request was posted.\r\n\r\nTo use, simply:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nbus.ReplyTo<BasicRequest, BasicResponse>(req => new BasicResponse {\r\n\tMessage = \"From server: \" + req.Message;\r\n});\r\n\r\nbus.Defer<BasicRequest, BasicResponse>();\r\n\r\nGuid cId = bus.Call(new BasicRequest { Message = \"Deferred \"});\r\n\r\nbus.Pickup<BasicRequest, BasicResponse>(cId, (req, res) =>\r\n{\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe call to `Pickup` will _block_. Also, deferred calls will by default be held for one minute, or be removed from the bus as soon as they are picked up.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkload management\r\n-------------------\r\n","google":"UA-45195914-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
